# 👋 Hello everyone

I'm a **Systems Engineering student** with experience working in various companies, which has helped me gain practical skills and a solid understanding of real-world professional environments.

One of my current goals is to master the **Java stack** and leverage it to advance my career in software development. I'm particularly interested in:

- 💻 **Backend development** with Java
- 🌱 Using frameworks like **Spring** and **Spring Boot**
- 🔗 Designing and consuming **REST APIs**
- 🗄️ Working with **relational databases** (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- 🧠 Applying software architecture principles and development best practices

I'm committed to continuous learning and excited about the challenges and opportunities that come with this technology.
